* :world_map: Lately I have been focused on **[Topo Lock Maps](https://www.topolock.com)**, a private end-to-end encrypted outdoor mapping solution.
* :wave: **[Get in touch with me](https://www.voncannontech.com/about)** if I can help with any of your software projects. I love projects related to the outdoors, information security, and mapping... but anything challenging will do!
